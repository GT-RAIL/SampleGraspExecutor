# sample_grasp_executor
An example node for executing a grasp using the remote_manipulation_markers package.

The code is designed to work with the GT-RAIL fork of the kinova-ros package for the 7-DOF Jaco2 arm with a robotiq-85 2-finger gripper, but the code has comments throughout denoting each module that would need to be replaced for different hardware.
